            <p>The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on
              Saturday 26 April 1986, at the No. 4 nuclear reactor in the
              Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the
              north of the Ukrainian SSR. The explosion led to there being a massive amount of radiation in the air.
              One of our guest speakers, Maynard Holiday, was one of the members who aided in the Chernobyl mission.
              Their goal was to create a robot that is able to sustain in the high amounts of radiation and
              collect data from the explosion.    </p>

      <p style = "font-size: 120%;">During my time in the engineering program, I
        have met a number of industry professionals through workplace field trips
        and guest speakers. One engineering field I am interested in is Civil
        Engineering. Emma Schoental, a civil engineer, came to our school as a
        guest speaker on this topic. She explained the multiple types of civil
        engineers, as well as types of projects that they work on. This guest
        speaker showed my the daily life of civil engineers and I was imspired
        by the process involved in a project and the use of simulation and
        AutoDesk, showing the need for numerous engineering principles involved
        in a single project. This guest speaker showed me the background of one of the engineering fields I am interested in 
        and also showed how the daily life of a civil engineer is like.
        One field trip that I attended is the Jet Patriot
        Flight Hanger. There, we were taught about the process of rocket launching
        and the necessities to launch a man onto the moon by the many volunteers
        of the Patriots Jet Team Foundation. This inspired me about the ideas that 
        can aid us with space travel. It also opened my eyes as to the difficult process in 
        developement and process needed in order to reach Mars. This gave me a great perspective of 
        aerodynamics and also showed that it could be part of my future career.</p>

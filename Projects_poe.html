             <p>For this project, we needed to build an efficient prototype winch
                which can lift extremely heavy objects up at least 3 stories (30cm)
                in a construction environment using a switch and Fischer Tech motor.
                We recieved an efficiency of 4.74% being able to carry 500g, using
                a gear ratio of 7:1 and a large winch head. Here is a link to the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15pYwD7fO9AaY2fS0X46tNT6yME1KP4LHYtjDNPp0AJQ/edit?usp=sharing" style = "color: #B7E9F7;">documentation</a></p>

                   In this project, my team and I needed to create a functioning
                    vechile using a solar and hydrogen fuel cell. During this
                    project, my main contribution was to help build the mechanism.
                     Since there were many awards for the designs, one being a
                     creative award, I explained that we should build a motorcycle shape.
                     This is due to a motorcycle having a relatively light shape,
                     making it easily move faster. In this project, I was the
                     lead builder as for I explained to my teammates the shape
                     and structure of the vehicle. Going through the design procress
                      numerous times, we finally created a functioning vehicle.
                      This project was difficult due to voltage and current
                      outputted by the hydrogen cells. These cells give so little
                      voltage, it is difficult for it to move a "heavy" vehicle.
                       At the end, I also created a 2D simulation on the parts of
                      the vehicle to test and present the values similar to our prototype.
                      I did this by using a GUI software called Netlogo and I simulated the
                      vehicle in its many configurations. I also worked to finalize the

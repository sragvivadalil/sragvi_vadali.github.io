                which can lift extremely heavy objects up at least 3 stories (30cm)
                in a construction environment using a switch and Fischer Tech motor.
                We recieved an efficiency of 4.74% being able to carry 500g, using

                   In this project, my team and I needed to create a functioning
                    vechile using a solar and hydrogen fuel cell. During this
                    project, my main contribution was to help build the mechanism.
                     Since there were many awards for the designs, one being a
                     creative award, I explained that we should build a motorcycle shape.
                     This is due to a motorcycle having a relatively light shape,
                     making it easily move faster. In this project, I was the
                     lead builder as for I explained to my teammates the shape
                     and structure of the vehicle. Going through the design procress
                      numerous times, we finally created a functioning vehicle.
                      This project was difficult due to voltage and current
                      outputted by the hydrogen cells. These cells give so little
                      voltage, it is difficult for it to move a "heavy" vehicle.
                       At the end, I also created a 2D simulation on the parts of
                      the vehicle to test and present the values similar to our prototype.
                      I did this by using a GUI software called Netlogo and I simulated the
                      vehicle in its many configurations. I also worked to finalize the

                 In this project, my team and I needed to create a projectile that can travel a large distance. During this
                  project, my main contribution was to create two designs of
                  projectiles. For this project, we needed to create a projectile
                  that can travel the farthest. This distance was tracked vertically.
                  For my projectile, I decided to create a rocket. This rocket was
                  created using printer paper and transparent packaging tape. When we
                  were testing the rockets, I decided that 45 degrees was the most
                  efficient angle to launch the rocket and it traveled 31 yards in 10 seconds at 60psi.
                  This was due to the wind catching the rocket and caused it to slow down faster.
                  Seeing my mistakes, I created another rocket similar to the previous rocket.
                  I created the body using two papers, cardstock and printer paper
                  and decided to decrease the fins size so that it doesn't catch onto the wind.
                  I also wrapped the entire rocket with duct tape and increase
                  the compression of the rocket. This rocket traveled 88 yards in
                  approximately 3 seconds. Another aspect of this project is creating a
                  2d simulation using NetLogo. Using Aerodynamic equations, I was able to create a
                  simulation for a rocket launch adding factors such as wind and initial velocity.
                  This helped me find the best angle of launch, testing them in the virtual simulation.

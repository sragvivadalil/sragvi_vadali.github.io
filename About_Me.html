I am a sophomore at Dublin High School, but most importantly, I am a member of the prestigious Engineering and Design Academy (DEDA) in Dublin High.  I am in the CS pathway and as part of that, currently pursuing Honors Principles of Engineering.  I have both short term and long term goals.  To begin with, I would like to graduate high school and get admitted into a good engineering college.  Then, I would like to graduate with an Engineering Degree and work for a renowned company that can help me to work on innovative products.  Eventually, I want to establish my own company and create products that are technologically advanced and aid society. In order to achieve these goals, I need to work hard and have a clear vision. Right from my childhood, I was always interested in Engineering.  I developed this passion by constantly seeing my parents solve problems using code and brother building numerous mechanisms to achieve a certain goal. Due to my role models being so immersed in engineering, I wanted to follow their footsteps and become an engineer myself.

      Outside of school, I am a member of a VEX Robotics competitive team known as Gael Force Robotics. Our objective is to create a mechanism given the constraints to achieve a working solution.  However, in order to achieve this, my team and I had to work countless hours on designing and building a plausible solution. This would lead me to work more than 10 hours on many days trying to figure out a new optimum method of achieving a working product. I needed to ensure that this product is completed in time, but also not let my grades slip. This made me have a good balance between robotics and schoolwork.

      In robotics, this is my second year in a competitive team. As a valued team member, I contribute by aiding with the construction of the robot, delegating roles for members, and help code the robot. I was also a member of Tri-valley Youth Expo, a corporation led my the Dublin mayor in order to plan out events that will occur in our community.In this group, my main role was to create marketing material that can advertise our events to the local residents using social media platforms. Collaborating with my teammate on a weekly basis, I helped them reach out to investors using these marketing tools. In addition to these, I am also a board member for a non-profit organization called Reaching to Society. In this non-profit, we aid the nearby homeless shelters, farm for the local residents, and also donate time and money to many other organizations who are trying to aid with preventing many deadly diseases.

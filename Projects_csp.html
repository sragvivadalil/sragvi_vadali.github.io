             <p>In the beginning of the year, we needed to code a mobile application

             without using any loops. My partner and I created an adventure based
             on the infamous story of Hansel and Gretel. We achieved this by doing
             multitreading - process to manage its use by more than one user at a
             time and to even manage multiple requests by the same user without
             having to have multiple copies of the programming running in the computer -
             creating a function for each scene. Here is a link to the <a target="_blank "href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c0J22tYaxMvxW6GCfXzn73w60_DPQcxNJtXJeya9Nhk/edit?usp=sharing" style = "color: #B7E9F7;">documentation</a></p>

           <p>Each year,  there is an entrepreneurship showcase for the PLTW students.
           Here, students create prototypes to solve problems around them. For this,
           my group created a storage unit that displays the amount of a unit is
           inside each container. We achieved this by using an Arduino and weight cells for the
           storage unit, coding them to show the amount in each based on the weight
           of the storage unit. The picture above is one of the storage compartments.

                      my coding skills. Even though I have past knowledge of this language,
                      I have not used it in many years, bringing me back to square one.
                      With my partner, Diego van Schie, I learned many things such as how
                      to randomize the location of my character. Even though we only had the instructions of building a
                      <strong>multi-level project,</strong> we worked together creating a
                      fun game. We, however, had many ideas beforehand, finally deciding to
                      choose a game about a wizard fighting his partner, and evil rouge wizard.
                      The main character's powers slowly progress, leading to him having a
                      "warping power", that allowed him to teleport around the map,and a lazer
                      that will move to the location of the mouse. From each level, the
                      character will gain one power at a time, making each level gradually difficult. At the end, we
                      learned many values such as coding skills, teamwork, and the power of

                 process to apply to images with a process to use some

         <p style="font-size: 88%; line-height: 2"> The design process was fairly
                    simply. We started the project by creating a brainstorming chart
                    and the constraints of the project. This allowed us to be able to
                    imagine the code in our head. After that, we created a template
                    on how we wanted to do the images as well as what the images will
                    look like. We were happy with our templates and started working
                    right away. With my partner's prior knowledge, we were able to create
                    a strong basis for our images and what we need to work on.
                    However, we made the code to complex that we didn’t understand
                    a way to perfectly streamline the code. This made it a little
                    more challenging. However, we were able to use the design process
                    and create a good image manipulator. I also learned many concepts
                    in Environmental Sciences. We were also able to develop on each
                    other’s strengths. Since Loic is a senior, he has more research
                    skills than me, causing it it be easier debug and create new ideas.
                    Ultimately both of those actions led to positive ideas for the
                    project but the whole process would have been more streamlined
                    had we better communicated our intentions to each other. At the
                    end, we learned the need of teamwork and
